A port of Steven Atkinson's Neural Amp Modeler to LV2. 

TooB Neural Amp Modeler uses uploadable .nam model files. Download .nam model files from http://tone3000.com, and then load them into TooB Neural Amp Modeler. 

The TONE3000 website contains a huge collection of community-developed amp models that can be used with TooB Neural Amp Modeler. You can also use .nam models from 
other sources. Using TONE3000 models with TooB Neural Amp Modeler is a two-step process. First, download model files to your local system using a
web browser. Then upload the model files to the PiPedal server using the PiPedal web interface. You can find an "Upload" button in
the file browser when you click on the "Model" control in the PiPedal web interface. 


If you are not using PiPedal, just click on the Model control, and use the file browser to select the .nam file directly on your local system.

TooB Neural Amp Modeler supports a much wider range of amp models than ToobML, but usually uses more CPU. 
You will need at least a Pi 4 to use Toob Neural Amp Modeler, and you may need to increase your audio buffer sizes to prevent overruns. 
If you are having trouble with CPU usage, tone3000.com does contain some smaller amp models. Search for the "feather" tag to find
models that use less CPU. Generally, you can use up to three NAM models at once in a given preset on a Pi 4, and up to 5 MAM models
simultaneously on a Pi 5. N100 micro PCs could presumably do even better. However, exact CPU use varies depending on the complexity of the amp models you are using.
Users have reported success using NAM on Raspberry Pi 3 devices, but this is not recommended (or really supported), as CPU usage is very high on a Raspberry Pi 3.
If you are interested in profiling your own amps and effect pedals, please visit https://www.tone3000.com/capture

When the Threaded control is on, neural amp modelling calculations are run on a separate thread from the 
real-time audio thread. This introduces one extra audio buffer of latency, but allows the plugin to make full 
use of all availble processor cores when running more than one instance of TooB Neural Amp Modeler. As a result, 
you can run more instances of TooB Neural Amp Modeler than you ordinarily could. On a Pi 5, you can run up to 8 
instances of TooB Neural Amp Modeler in a single preset (as opposed to four or five), and up to 5 instances of TooB 
Neural Amp Modeler (as opposed to two or three). 

You need to check that the  PiPedal server's CPU is not temperature throttling 
when using this feature. If the CPU temperature exceeds 80 degrees Celcius on a Raspberry Pi, the CPU clock rate is reduced, and
the performance of the plugins will be affected. Having a good heat sink, or active cooling system is recommended when using this feature. 
PiPedal displays the current CPU temperature in a status message at the bottom of the display (unless you've turned 
that off in settings), and also displays the current CPU temperature in the status message found at the top 
of the Settings page. The exact temperature at which the CPU starts to throttle varies from computer to computer. If 
you are running on a system that is not a Raspberry Pi, please consult your manufacturer's help documentation 
to find out what temperature heat throttling starts at on your particular computer, if you really need to know 
what the threshold is; but the effect on performance is pretty obvious when heat throttling does start. 

Note that heat throttling is done to protect your processor from permanent damage due to overheating; but there's no real risk of actual 
damage, since heat throttling thresholds are set well below the point at which damage occurs. 

TooB Neural Amp Modeler contains code optimizations that allow use of a third model on Raspberry PI 4 devices. These optimizations
were offered to the upstream NAM project, but we recommended that they not be merged into upstream sources, because they
significantly affect maintainability of the codebase. and the performance increase they provide (about 30%) is really only
relevant on Raspberry PI 4-class devices. If you are interested in these optimizations, they have been published in ToobAmp
project sources on GitHub.

TooB Neural Amp Modeler uses code from the NeuralAmp Modeler Core project (https://www.neuralampmodeler.com/). The TooB team wishes 
to express gratitude to Steven Atkinson for making this revolutionary technology available as open-source code. This is groundbreaking 
technology that changes everything; and work that would be impossible to replicate without the work that Steven has done.

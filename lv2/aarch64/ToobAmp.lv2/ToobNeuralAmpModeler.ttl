TooB Neural Amp Modeler is a neural network based Amp Simulator. It uses .nam model files that are generated by training nueral networks 
on audio recordings of actual guitar amps, effects pedals and other equipment. .nam files contain data from the trained models, which can be loaded into 
TooB Neural Amp Modeler.  The resulting models produce startlingly realistic emulations of the original equipment. 

The .nam file format (and the NAM technology itself) was developed by the open-source Neural Amp Modeler Core project. The NAM Core project provides both code that can be used by Neural Amp Modeler
plugins, and code that can be used to train models for use in NAM plugins. Currently, NAM plugins are available on a wide variety of operating systems and audio platforms, and are 
increasingly being used in commercial pedals and amps. 

Although NAM is, first and foremost, used to model guitar amps, it is equally good at emulating a wide variety of other guitar effects. Overdrive and distortion pedals, 
compressors, limiters, tube preamps on studio mixing strips, and many other effects can be simulated extremely well using NAM models. NAM will definitely become 
your go-to source for great amp emulations; but it should probably also become your go-to source for emulating distorion and overdrive pedals. And developers 
are constantly coming up with new and ingenious applications for NAM models.

.nam model files can be donwloaded from the internet. There are many online sources for .nam model files, both free, and commercial. Foremost among these is the 
http://tone3000.com website, which provides a vast collection of free .nam models files that have been developed and uploaded by a large online community of NAM users. 

Loading .nam model files into PiPedal is a two-step process. First, download model files to your local computer, or your phone or tablet, using a
web browser. Then upload the model files to the PiPedal server using the PiPedal web interface. You can find an "Upload" button in
the file browser when you click on the "Model" control in the plugin's user interface  within the PiPedal web interface.

If you are not using PiPedal, just click on the Model control, and use the file browser to select the .nam file directly on your local system.

TooB Neural Amp Modeler supports a much wider range of amp models than ToobML, but usually uses more CPU. 
You will need at least a Pi 4 to use Toob Neural Amp Modeler, and you may need to increase your audio buffer sizes to prevent overruns. 
If you are having trouble with CPU usage, tone3000.com does contain some smaller amp models. Search for the "feather" tag to find
models that use less CPU. Generally, you can use up to three NAM plugins at once in a given preset on a Pi 4, and up to 16 NAM plugins
simultaneously on a Pi 5. However, exact CPU use varies depending on the complexity of the amp models you are using.

If you are interested in profiling your own amps and effect pedals, please visit https://www.tone3000.com/capture

When the Threaded control is on, neural amp modelling calculations are run on a separate thread from the 
real-time audio thread. This introduces one extra audio buffer of latency, but allows the plugin to make full 
use of all available processor cores on your Pi server. On a Pi 5, you can run more instance than you 
could ever practically use when using threading; on a Pi 4 you can run 5 simultanous instances when using threading. 

When using more than a couple of NAM instances, you need to check that the  PiPedal server's CPU is not temperature throttling 
when using this feature. 
If the CPU temperature exceeds 80 degrees Celcius on a Raspberry Pi, the CPU clock rate is reduced, and
the performance of the plugins will be affected. Having a good heat sink, or active cooling system is recommended when using more than a couple of 
NAM instances. PiPedal displays the current CPU temperature in a status message at the bottom of the display (unless you've turned 
that off in settings), and also displays the current CPU temperature in the status message found at the top 
of the Settings page. If you are running on a system that is not a Raspberry Pi, please consult your manufacturer's 
help documentation to find out what temperature heat throttling starts at on your particular computer, if you really need to know 
what the threshold is; but the effect on performance is pretty obvious when heat throttling does start. 

Note that heat throttling is done to protect your processor from permanent damage due to overheating; but there's no real risk of actual 
damage, since heat throttling thresholds are set well below the point at which damage occurs. 

TooB Neural Amp Modeler is based on technology developed by the NeuralAmp Modeler Core project (https://www.neuralampmodeler.com/). The TooB team wishes 
to express gratitude to Steven Atkinson for making this revolutionary technology available as open-source code. This is groundbreaking 
technology that changes everything. None of this would have happened without the work that Steven has done.

TooB Neural Amp Modeler uses code from the NeuralAudio project (https://github.com/mikeoliphant/NeuralAudio). The Neural Audio project provides highly 
optimized implementations of Neural Amp models. The TooB team wishes to express gratitude to Mike Oliphant for 
making his optimizations work available as open-source code. 

Steve and Mike have done all of the hard work that was required to make NAM technology available through TooB Neural Amp Modeler. They 
deserve all the credit.
